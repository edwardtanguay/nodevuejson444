# nodevuejson444

This is class Node/Express single-page site with Vue.js, very Datapod like, reads flashcards from a JSON file, and uses CSS. You can of course make various pages, e.g. there is a /test page and then link between them, so would be a nice base for a manual Vue site. **Has good code for adding elements to JSON files from from end, with await/async unshift.** See also in the root directory `test_navs.html` which is the navigation of the onespapce site. Doesn't run at Netlify (no build script) go good for local projects.
